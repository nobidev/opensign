### Step 6: Finalizing the Process

To sign the document, the signer clicks the **Signature widget**, which provides options to **draw**, **upload**, or **type** their signature.
If any signer fields were prefilled by the document owner, the signer can review and edit those values if needed. After completing all required fields, the signer should click **Finish**.

- If the signer is the **final signer**, they will have the option to **download or print** the signed document along with the **Completion Certificate**.  
- If there are **multiple signers**, the document will automatically move to the next signer. Once all signers have completed the process, each signer will be able to **download and print** the final signed document and Completion Certificate.
