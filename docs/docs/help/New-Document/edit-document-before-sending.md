# How to edit a document before sending in OpenSign‚Ñ¢?

OpenSign‚Ñ¢ lets you polish your PDF before you send it out‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre signing it yourself, requesting signatures, or saving it as a template. You get four core editing controls right in the preview:

- **Add Pages**  
  In the left-side panel, users will see an **"Add" button**. Clicking it allows users to select and merge new documents into the current one.

- **Delete Page**  
  An option is available to **delete** any unwanted page from the document.

- **Reorder Pages**  
  Users can reorder pages by clicking the **"Reorder" button**, which opens a popup displaying all pages. Use the **Up** and **Down** arrows to change the order. Click **Save** to apply the new page order.

- **Zoom In / Zoom Out**  
  Controls are available to **zoom in** or **zoom out** of the document view.

- **Rotate Page**  
  Options are provided to **rotate pages** in both **clockwise** and **counterclockwise** directions.

## Prefill widgets

Simply select the Prefill by Owner option from the right-side panel to view all available prefill widgets. Choose the desired widget and drag it into your document.
The Prefill Widgets feature allows document creators to enter specific information in advance before sending a document for signatures. This helps ensure that essential details ‚Äî such as names, dates, emails, images, checkboxes, radio buttons, or custom text ‚Äî are already filled in when recipients receive the document. Prefilled data remains locked and cannot be modified by signers.
